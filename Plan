NEXT:
	Personal Inventory (on island) √
	Option to buy groves and mines √
	Player location √
		- make display on map √
	Facility prices don't make sense √
		- facility prices increase faster in bulk buy than incremental buy
		- Facility maximum √
	Goods prices don't make sense √
	Buy facilities √
	Facilities produce into inventory local to island
	Then you can sell
	Clock
		- scarcity of everything goes down (slowly) over time √
		- goal of game is to make as much profit as possible before all scarcity === 0!
	Sales lower scarcity for a bit. Island has a consumption rate based on "natural scarcity" i.e. original scarcity.
	Exporting

	Minimum:
		- producing from facilities √
		- selling from facilities √ bugs
		- clock increasing non-player facilities √
			- make sure scarcity is reacting √
				- and make it neat code!
		- exporting
			- base delivery time on distance √
				- exports time measured in seconds, should be measured in days
			- Selling and receiving islands are tracked √
				- if not specified, receiving and selling islands are equal to player's location √
				- distance/time calculations currently hidden--find room in island stat panel to display these (when exporting, or just always?)
	Better:
		- moving between islands, building on them √
			- 'move' button in selected island panel √
			- time depends on distance again √
			- production based on either √
				- player is on that island
				- player has industry of same type on that island
		- populations consuming goods bought, scarcity reacts with negative spike and rise return √
		- populations growing logarithmically?

	Even better:
		- BC date counter instead of "Day: "

	ISSUE:
		Major Bugs:
			- price being based on scarcity of buyer island post-product-infusion (scarcity change is affecting price before sale is done)
			- sale maximums need to be limited to scarcity reaching 0 (price reaches 0)
				- currently goes past 0 and negative price values reached
			- can click sell button multiple times before transaction goes through with exporting
				- multiple sales not reflecting actual player stockpile (is player stockpile amt not checked again during transaction? prob not)
			- player stockpile should be affectd immdiately upon export click--gold influx takes timeout
		ISLAND CREATION:
			Object literals cannot refer to their own properties in the dynamic sort of way that I am trying to 
			implement for the island stat generation function. Use getters or create objects from constructors.
		Infinity scarcity!
		Selection order too particular with goods/facilities buttons and fields
		Exporting island too invisible... turn it orange until its changed (regardless of selected island... for instance if export button is off)
		Gold from (especially domestic?) sales don't add up
		Some variables which are global should be properties on island, probably
		+ other Scope/refactoring things like this
		I'm repeating myself
		Craziness going on with facility scarcity variables and parameters


Export Island vs Selected Island
	- if exporting, selection moves export island and selected island
	- if not exporting, selection only moves selected island




Trade between islands
	Copper and olive oil

Islands all have stats
	population
	number of olive groves and maximum
	number of copper mines and maximum

Sell olive oil to rocky islands with few trees
Sell copper to lush islands with few rocks

Trades take time based on distance between islands

You trade olive oil for copper and copper for olive oil

Spend copper and olive oil to build groves and mines (no currency)

Olive oil is more valuable where it is harder to make
Copper is more valuable where it is harder to mine


Scarcity rating: 0 to 10
Scarcity rating rises faster based on difficulty of producing something domestically
The higher the scarcity rating, the more you can get with that good
The more you sell to an island, the lower the scarcity rating goes
The more you put in a sale, the lower the price is per item (bulk/demand curve)
	- try this out
		- Need:
			- click button to increase number, watch price per item go down, watch total price go up.
				- opposite is true of sales
			- transaction segment of page

Island Stats:
	- type
		- lushness, rockiness, in percentages
	- scarcity, 0.0 to 10.0
		- olive oil
		- copper
	- population
	- price is a function of scarcity and population

	- for each island created on map, assign stats
		- stats visible when selected
		- stats assigned to global variables used in price function


Transactions
	- if island is selected, use scarcity value for functions
		- button switch between olive oil and copper
	- enable buying groves or mines based on maxes

	- i cannot buy copper and olive oil, only sell it
		- I buy groves and mines

	- what about communication? how do I tell my people on different islands what to do?
		- i pick an island to situate myself on at a given moment. takes me time to move between islands.
		- And I have an agent (who player functions as) anywhere I have built a grove or mine... elsewhere I cannot see unless I go. 
		- Only I can buy groves and mines in person (agents are stationary and not authorized to expand to different businesses but can expand to more of what they do (grove or mine))
		- island I am on changes color when I am on it
		- inventory piles up on each island it's produced on. can be sold to any island, time depends on distance. Price is price upon arrival unless I have a grove there then the local agent can secure a price for future delivery.

Player wealth
	- My mines on island
	- My groves on island
		- as opposed to all others
	- groves and mines I put on an island do not affect scarcity of goods there, that still determined by groves and mines of others... but honestly why wouldn't i sell there first-return is fastest (measured in seconds or turns? leaning towards seconds. with pause button)

Mines and Groves
	- mines and groves construction time directly proportional to cost
		- e.g. 1 second per 10 coin cost (1800 coins = 180 seconds = 3 minutes)


NOTES:
	- Too many global variables?
	- Repeating myself with trackQuantity() calls?
	- Too many islands with identical scarcity values
	- Non-sensical scarcity values when maxGroves = 0 but population is low
		- But is it non-sensical?
	- Problem: must select island before good/facility button. Should not matter.
	- Eventually hide the scarcity number
	- Natural price difference between oil and copper?
