	Personal Inventory (on island) √
	Option to buy groves and mines √
	Player location √
		- make display on map √
	Facility prices don't make sense √
		- facility prices increase faster in bulk buy than incremental buy
		- Facility maximum √
	Goods prices don't make sense √
	Buy facilities √
	Facilities produce into inventory local to island
	Then you can sell
	Clock
		- scarcity of everything goes down (slowly) over time
		- goal of game is to make as much profit as possible before all scarcity === 0!
	Sales lower scarcity for a bit. Island has a consumption rate based on "natural scarcity" i.e. original scarcity.
	Exporting

	ISSUE:
		Some variables which are global should be properties on island, probably
		+ other Scope/refactoring things like this
		I'm repeating myself
		Craziness going on with facility scarcity variables and parameters




Trade between islands
	Copper and olive oil

Islands all have stats
	population
	number of olive groves and maximum
	number of copper mines and maximum

Sell olive oil to rocky islands with few trees
Sell copper to lush islands with few rocks

Trades take time based on distance between islands

You trade olive oil for copper and copper for olive oil

Spend copper and olive oil to build groves and mines (no currency)

Olive oil is more valuable where it is harder to make
Copper is more valuable where it is harder to mine


Scarcity rating: 0 to 10
Scarcity rating rises faster based on difficulty of producing something domestically
The higher the scarcity rating, the more you can get with that good
The more you sell to an island, the lower the scarcity rating goes
The more you put in a sale, the lower the price is per item (bulk/demand curve)
	- try this out
		- Need:
			- click button to increase number, watch price per item go down, watch total price go up.
				- opposite is true of sales
			- transaction segment of page

Island Stats:
	- type
		- lushness, rockiness, in percentages
	- scarcity, 0.0 to 10.0
		- olive oil
		- copper
	- population
	- price is a function of scarcity and population

	- for each island created on map, assign stats
		- stats visible when selected
		- stats assigned to global variables used in price function


Transactions
	- if island is selected, use scarcity value for functions
		- button switch between olive oil and copper
	- enable buying groves or mines based on maxes

	- i cannot buy copper and olive oil, only sell it
		- I buy groves and mines

	- what about communication? how do I tell my people on different islands what to do?
		- i pick an island to situate myself on at a given moment. takes me time to move between islands.
		- And I have an agent (who player functions as) anywhere I have built a grove or mine... elsewhere I cannot see unless I go. 
		- Only I can buy groves and mines in person (agents are stationary and not authorized to expand to different businesses but can expand to more of what they do (grove or mine))
		- island I am on changes color when I am on it
		- inventory piles up on each island it's produced on. can be sold to any island, time depends on distance. Price is price upon arrival unless I have a grove there then the local agent can secure a price for future delivery.

Player wealth
	- My mines on island
	- My groves on island
		- as opposed to all others
	- groves and mines I put on an island do not affect scarcity of goods there, that still determined by groves and mines of others... but honestly why wouldn't i sell there first-return is fastest (measured in seconds or turns? leaning towards seconds. with pause button)

Mines and Groves
	- mines and groves construction time directly proportional to cost
		- e.g. 1 second per 10 coin cost (1800 coins = 180 seconds = 3 minutes)


NOTES:
	- Too many global variables?
	- Repeating myself with trackQuantity() calls?
	- Too many islands with identical scarcity values
	- Non-sensical scarcity values when maxGroves = 0 but population is low
		- But is it non-sensical?
	- Problem: must select island before good/facility button. Should not matter.
	- Eventually hide the scarcity number
	- Natural price difference between oil and copper?
