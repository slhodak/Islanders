i think my way of assigning colors to the divs based on selections is probably not even on a very good track. I already know I'm going to refactor it, but it looks like it could be better done using tools I'm completely neglecting.

What if I create an object:
  {
    selectedIsland: undefined,
    exportIsland: undefined,
    playerLocation: undefined
  }

And I assign things to these slots based on whether I'm picking the export island or moving the player or not

Then at the end of the assignments I evaluate the object to decide what color the element will be

But I also have to keep track of which element was taken out of the object
That element will get changed back

As for the player movement taking time, I'll make the destination island maroon immediately but I'll put an 'in transit' notice in the player's panel

For instance:

  obj = {
    selectedIsland: myKonos,
    exportIsland: Knossos,
    playerLocation: Argos
  };

  I click on an island and exporting is off:

  obj[selectedIsland].attr('id', 'island');
  obj[selectedIsland] = selection;

  wabam!
-------------------
  So you can sell things based on whether you are there or whether you have an industry of that type on the island
  More use of objects seems helpful here
