i think my way of assigning colors to the divs based on selections is probably not even on a very good track. I already know I'm going to refactor it, but it looks like it could be better done using tools I'm completely neglecting.

What if I create an object:
  {
    selectedIsland: undefined,
    exportIsland: undefined,
    playerLocation: undefined
  }

And I assign things to these slots based on whether I'm picking the export island or moving the player or not

Then at the end of the assignments I evaluate the object to decide what color the element will be

But I also have to keep track of which element was taken out of the object
That element will get changed back

As for the player movement taking time, I'll make the destination island maroon immediately but I'll put an 'in transit' notice in the player's panel

For instance:

  obj = {
    selectedIsland: myKonos,
    exportIsland: Knossos,
    playerLocation: Argos
  };

  I click on an island and exporting is off:

  obj[selectedIsland].attr('id', 'island');
  obj[selectedIsland] = selection;

  wabam!
-------------------
  You can sell things to anyone but only from islands where you produce
  You can only buy industries on playerLocation or islands where you have previously built in that industry
  More use of objects seems helpful here

  When export is toggled on, you sell between import/export islands,
    otherwise sales occur from and to playerLocation (if possible)

What to display in player stat panel?
  - Birthplace
  - total mines, total groves
  - total # islands built on
  - profits to date
  - revenue to date
